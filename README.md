# Syllabus and News for CS594/690: Advanced Software Engineering

* **Course:** [COSCS-540]
* ** TuTh 09:45AM-11:00 mk622 and online Zoom bridge https://tennessee.zoom.us/j/86089126911 ** 
** [recordings](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1N0DH4_UUuO3c0ubC14zeqEywJHjNg6iZ?usp=sharing)
* **Instructor:** Audris Mockus, [audris@utk.edu](mailto:audris@utk.edu) office hours - on request
* **TA** [Shivam Patel](mailto:spatel84@vols.utk.edu) office hours - TBD

The primary purpose of the course is to learn-by-doing advanced
software engineering techniques including:
1. Big Data
1. Text analysis, e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe, NMF, LDA, LSTM
2. Image analysis, e.g., RCNN, Mask-RCNN, CAM, ...
3. Network analysis, network databases (neo4j), ...
4. Generativere models

Each of the techniques will be learned through work on a real project.
